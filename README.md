CRM-Analytics
Problem statement:
A next generation customer relationship management tool
Those endless stream of messages and notifications from e-Commerce and food ordering sites spam your inbox. Have you ever felt like ordering anything from their portal? You would have if it was message a from Dominos 'BUY 1 GET ONE WITH XYZ CODE' . If so what is effective customer relationship management , how do you go from hating those dreadful notification to actually building a meaningful relationship between a brand and a customer. Come up with a disruptive solution to handle promotions in e-Commerce/food industry
Proposed Solution:
Rather than randomly push data to the users, we will smartly analyse the user behavior and send appropriate coupons to the customer. The android app on user smartphones will collect various information like WiFi usage, location information in the background at frequent intervals without causing problems to general phone usage. This information will be pushed to our cloud servers.At our cloud server we will also have coupon information of our customers. We will match this information with the android information and send appropriate coupons to the users. Through our frontend business owners will be able to see there coupon usages as well as generate new coupons based on there inventory stocks.
